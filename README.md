# ddoswifi

by VKing34

Kick off all clients of the marked wifi

Copy "ddoswifi" and "airmon" to /usr/bin/ 
and execute them by the command - "chmod +x ddoswifi" "chmod +x airmon"
then "cd /urs/bin" and "ddoswifi" to begin.

All the required tools are listed before starting the program.
So if you're missing some ones, just install them by Linux Terminal with some simple commands.
*Don't use it for bad purpose.
