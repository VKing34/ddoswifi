# ddoswifi

by VKing34

Kick all clients off a marked wifi

1, Copy "ddoswifi" and "airmon" to /usr/bin/

2, "cd /urs/bin" then execute them by the command - "chmod +x ddoswifi" & "chmod +x airmon"

3, Type "ddoswifi" to begin.

All the required tools are listed before starting the program.
So if you're missing some ones, just install them by Linux Terminal with some simple commands. "sudo apt-get install (toolsname)"

*Don't use it for bad purposes.
